## Inspiration
In a world where everything comes with a price, Have you ever wondered how some of the most amazing online services like social - media are free of cost? what's the other side of this coin? Spoiler Alert !! it's not free. We pay for these services with our time and attention. 
## What it does
In the Book "Atomic Habits" by habitcoach James Clear, He points out that having an accountability partner can prove to be very useful when it comes to breaking a bad habit. Anthropological Experiments support this claim as it shows that simply knowing someone is watching you can be a powerful motivator to do or not do something. Focusing on this as our virtue, we developed an application which connects users with their peers to help with increasing productivity by regulating the userâ€™s screen time and thereby screen time addiction. Our application ensures both user and his/her peer play role in managing the user's screen time. We believe habits stay with you when its inculcated and not enforced. 
## How we built it
Since we didn't want anyone else to miss our amazing app, we chose flutter for the development.  Firebase helped us to manage your data and keep it safe and also we took use of OneSignal to keep the users updated about their peers.
